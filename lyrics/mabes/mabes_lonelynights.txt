"Lonely Nights"



Caught in the rain, ran for the bus but I missed it
And I'm smoking again, hate how I become so addicted
'Cause I crack at the weight of the world day to day
And I need an escape so it's not totally self-inflicted

And I just can't get no damn sleep

Living for the weekend, nothing to believe in now you've gone
Little teenage dreams are ripping at the seams, I can't hold on
Maybe it's karma for all of the drama
I caused my mama when I was younger
Love can be deceiving, it's a funny feeling
Now the lonely nights go on and on and on
Lonely nights go on and on, and on and on and on

More of the same (same) silence just like I predicted
And the voice in my brain is cryptic and so pessimistic
'Cause the squeeze only gave me this flat lemonade
And it flows through my veins making me all bitter and twisted

And I just can't get no damn sleep

Living for the weekend, nothing to believe in now you've gone
Little teenage dreams are ripping at the seams, I can't hold on
Maybe it's karma for all of the drama
I caused my mama when I was younger
Love can be deceiving, it's a funny feeling
Now the lonely nights go on and on and on
Lonely nights go on and on, and on and on and on

This bedroom feels so haunted
I miss your bedside talking
Never felt so unwanted
This bedroom feels so haunted
I miss your bedside talking
Never felt so unwanted

Living for the weekend, nothing to believe in now you've gone
Little teenage dreams are ripping at the seams, I can't hold on
Maybe it's karma for all of the drama
I caused my mama when I was younger
Love can be deceiving, it's a funny feeling
Now the lonely nights go on and on and on
Lonely nights go on and on, and on and on
Now the lonely nights go on and on and on
Lonely nights go on and on, and on and on and on

(Yeah, I've watched this episode like three times. I keep restarting it but nothings going in. I think I've got like insomnia or something. Maybe I'm drinking too much coffee. Yeah I don't know, I just sit here... just staring at the ceiling.)
