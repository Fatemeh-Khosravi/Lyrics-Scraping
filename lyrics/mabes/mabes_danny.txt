"Danny"



Danny had the loudest laugh
He knows it, he knows it
Danny had the fullest heart
He shows it, he shows it
Danny had the loudest laugh
And Danny had the fullest heart
He did, he did, he did

Danny had to work all day
He loved it, he loved it
And Danny had to smoke all day
'Cause he left me, he left me
Danny had to go away
Said he was gonna get paid
He did, he did, he did

And he said, "It's alright, it's alright
I'll be right by your side
It's alright, it's alright
'Cause I'm still by your side
It's alright, it's alright
'Cause I'm right by your side"
But Danny liked to lie
'Cause he said, "I'd never say goodbye"

Got on a big old train
To London, London
Said he had to catch a plane
And left me wondering
If he'd ever come home again
Said he'd come home again
He did, he did, he did

Gone for a year or so
Chasing money
He called me on the phone
"Hello, honey"
Said he still loved me so
More than I'd ever know
He did, he did, he did

And he said, "It's alright, it's alright
I'll be right by your side
It's alright, it's alright
'Cause I'm still by your side
It's alright, it's alright
'Cause I'm right by your side"
But Danny liked to lie
'Cause he said, "I'd never say goodbye"

Got a letter in the mail
Danny's ship had just set sail
Caught out by a hundred guns
Danny had nowhere to run
Well, I guess it was his time
And I'm doing fine
Now Danny's just a dream at night
Oh he sings a lullaby

"It's alright, it's alright
I'll be right by your side
"It's alright, it's alright
'Cause I'm still by your side
It's alright, it's alright
I'll be right by your side"
But Danny was a liar
'Cause he said, "I'd never say goodbye"
