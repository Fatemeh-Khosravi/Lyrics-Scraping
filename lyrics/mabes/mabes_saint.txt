"Saint"



I am a lion
On the edge of a cliff just biding my time
Can I wait all night for a Saint to rescue me
Would I wait all night would I

And I am a tree
On the edge of a woods just planting my seed
Could I dream for a Saint to rescue me
Would I wait all night to dream

Oh would I would I
Oh would I would I
Oh would I would I would I

And he was a stone
Was a rock but he rolled, now he kicks it alone
Is he the one that's come to rescue me
Should I wait all night to know

Oh should I should I
Oh should I should I
Oh should I should I should I

Now he is a ghost
A vision impaired, a fiction at most
Just a ghost that keeps on haunting me
Will I ever let him go

Oh will I will I
Oh will I will I
Oh will I will I will I
