"Bigger Picture"



Waiting up, your face is red
I'm drunk again and home at way past ten
"Your numbers on the wall", you said
That they meant something different in my head

And I would shout 'cause I believed
That you were way too hard on me
You would never give permission
I was sitting in the kitchen, crying
Papa, you would have been different
But you were doing more than nine-to-five

You get older and it hits ya
Seventeen, I was bitch to ya
But now I see the bigger picture

Packed a bag late one night
Walked out tall with water in my eyes
Called a cab and took a ride
Came back smaller, swallowing my pride

And I would shout 'cause I believed
That you were a missing part of me
You would never give permission
I was sitting in the kitchen, crying
Papa, you would have been different
But you were doing more than nine-to-five

You get older and it hits ya
Seventeen, I was bitch to ya
But now I see the bigger picture

I thought life was made for me
A hundred things I couldn't see
Thought I was cool and you were mean
But I was so naive

'Cause you would never give permission
I was sitting in the kitchen, crying
Papa, would have been so different
You were doing more than nine-to-five

You would never give permission
I was sitting in the kitchen, crying
Papa, you would have been different
But you were doing more than nine-to-five

You get older and it hits ya
Seventeen, I was bitch to ya
But now I see the bigger picture
