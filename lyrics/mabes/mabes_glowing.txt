"Glowing"



What the hell we waiting for
'Cause life is short and I'm so bored of being alone
All my friends keep telling me
Don't jump right in but honestly, I can't let it go, no no no

Jumped in the deep end, been here all weekend
Talking for hours, don't know where it's going
Let's cut the bullshit 'cause I really like it
When we're together, yeah you got me glowing, glowing, boy
You got me glowing, boy
Glowing, glowing, boy

I'm no good at trusting people
But your smile, it makes me wanna keep you around
I don't ever get like this
But when we kiss it's hard to keep my feet on the ground, whoa-whoa-wow

Jumped in the deep end, been here all weekend
Talking for hours, don't know where it's going
Let's cut the bullshit 'cause I really like it
When we're together, yeah you got me glowing, glowing, boy
You got me glowing, boy
Glowing, glowing, boy
You got me glowing, boy

Crazy, crazy what you've done
'Cause I don't even want someone
But you make it so much fun
Maybe, maybe if you're free
Come on over, watch TV
'Cause I like your company

I jumped in the deep end, been here all weekend
Talking for hours, don't know where it's going
Let's cut the bullshit, 'cause I really like it
When we're together, you got me glowing, glowing, boy
You got me glowing, boy
You got me glowing, boy
You got me glowing
