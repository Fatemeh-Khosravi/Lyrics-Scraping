"Radio"



I swear I'm not missing ya
I'm just kinda reminiscing us
But don't worry 'cause life goes on
And I
I think I lost the photograph
I usually just skip the track
Every time that I hear that sound
That sound

In the back seat of a taxi
Hearing songs we used to know
Someone help me 'cause there's nowhere I can go

I thought about you late last night
When I heard it on the radio
It took me straight back to that night
You played it on your stereo
And there's something about that melody
It got me feeling 17
And now it always hits me every time
I hear it on the radio

And it goes like la la la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la la la-la-la-la
Then it goes like la la la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la la la-la-la-la
(Oo-oo-ooh ooh)

You took me to that restaurant
With ripped jeans and Kickers on
I was mad, you were sad 'cause you got it wrong
So, uhm
Remember when I threw you out
I'm laughing 'cause it's funny now
Stupid things that we do when we are young

In the back seat of a taxi
Hearing songs we used to know
Will someone help me 'cause there's nowhere I can go

I thought about you late last night
When I heard it on the radio
It took me straight back to that night
You played it on your stereo
And there's something about that melody
It got me feeling 17
And it always gets me every time
I hear it on the radio

I think it went like la la la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la la la-la-la-la
I think it went like la la la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la la la-la-la-la
Think it went like la la la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la la la-la-la-la
Think it went like la la la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la la la-la-la-la

Think it went like la la la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la la la-la-la-la
I think it went like la la la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la la la-la-la-la
(Oo-oo-ooh ooh)

And it always gets me every time
I hear it on the radio
