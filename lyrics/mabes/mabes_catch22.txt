"Catch 22"



Funny how it goes when
Love has slipped away
Friend becomes a foe and
Everything has changed
Guess we made our bed so
Here I gotta lay

Yes, I was strange
Now you're a stranger
Every week I'm getting weaker

'Cause there's been sunshine for days
Got a great big smile on my face
I've been dancing all evening
Know it's hard to believe it
But I shut the door at night
A million tears leave my eyes
I sink in this mattress
And I'm stuck in this catch 22

Heart is turned to stone but
Been bleeding out for days
It hurts to be alone but
I told you not to stay
What do we now 'cause
We can't win either way

I can't live with, can't live without ya
Was I right or wrong to doubt ya?

'Cause there's been sunshine for days
Got a great big smile on my face
I've been dancing all evening
Know it's hard to believe it
But I shut the door at night
A million tears leave my eyes
I sink in this mattress
And I'm stuck in this catch 22

Gotta leave to get the closure
Here I go, packing up all my clothes
That's the part where you start holding onto me
Feels like I can't breathe
Don't you see
Every weak I'm getting weaker?

'Cause there's been sunshine for days
Got a great big smile on my face
I've been dancing all evening
Know it's hard to believe it
But I shut the door at night
A million tears leave my eyes
I sink in this mattress
And I'm stuck in this catch 22

(Sink in this mattress)
(I sink in this mattress)
(Stuck in this)
