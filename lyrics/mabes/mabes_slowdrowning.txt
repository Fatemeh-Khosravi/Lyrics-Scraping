"Slow Drowning"



There was nothing I could do to ever fool ya
I've been 'round and 'round this place just trying to find ya
I've been tryna spell it out but nothing's clearer
And you hold my body down

I guess it's timing but your heart was never sure, my love
About the bigger things that you and I were speaking of
You gave a little hope, my dear, and was it just enough
To lay my body down

Holy fire, I've been burning
In your water, I am sinking
Slow
And, darling
When the Earth, it started moving
I lost the air we were breathing
Oh, oh, oh
I'm slow drowning

Even now when I look back, I see your shadow
And it follows me around wherever I go
Like a precious little secret only you'd know
To lay my body down

Holy fire, I've been burning
In your water, I am sinking
Slow
And, darling
When the Earth, it started moving
I lost the air we were breathing
Oh, oh, oh
I'm slow drowning

And I'm moving backwards just looking at you
And the fire around your feet
I know there's a fortune coming for you
But, baby, it's not me

'Cause when you laid my body down
You wore my body down

Holy fire, I've been burning
In your water, I am sinking
Slow
And, darling
When the Earth, it started moving
I lost the air we were breathing
Oh, oh, oh
I'm slow
I'm slow drowning
