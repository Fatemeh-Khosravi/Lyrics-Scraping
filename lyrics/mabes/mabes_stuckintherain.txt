"Stuck In The Rain"



Calling all souls lost in the wind
Calling all hearts beginning again
Shouting out to the sinners that need forgiveness
All the people tryna catch their breath

'Cause sometimes falling
Feels like you're flying
Till you hit the ground
And it all comes crashing down

Starting to run and
Still getting nowhere
Lost my luck
And it all seems so unfair

So why do I fall so deep
And find it so hard to keep
My head where it needs to be?
Forgetting that I have to breath

Tomorrow's another day
I'll pick myself up again
Might feel like a hurricane
But I'm just a little stuck in the rain
Stuck in the rain (Just a little stuck in the rain)

Time will mend the damage that's been done
Making friends again with the moon and the sun
Won't mistake my madness for a weakness
It's such a good feeling to know what I'm feeling

'Cause sometimes falling
Feels like I'm flying
Till I hit the ground
And it all comes crashing down, down

So why do I fall so deep
And find it so hard to keep
My head where it needs to be?
Forgetting that I have to breath

Tomorrow's another day
I'll pick myself up again
Might feel like a hurricane
But I'm just a little stuck in the rain
Stuck in the rain

Just a little stuck in the rain
Might feel like a hurricane
Just a little stuck in the rain
Stuck in the rain
(Ooh, stuck in the rain)
Just a little stuck in the rain
Might feel like a hurricane
Just a little stuck in the rain
Stuck in the rain, stuck in the rain
