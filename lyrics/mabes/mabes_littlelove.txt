"Little Love"



Oh, gracious things
Why do you run away?
And all good words and things escape this place
Are these bodies to blame
For playing the Midas game
Or am I just a shame upon the world?

But I'm getting by
Just getting on

But oh, this little love I hear so much about
I always give it back
Just give a little love, it's what they're talking about
I always give it back
Yeah, I give a lot just for a little love

Try not to scream
When the visions of collisions awake you
'Cause long gone are the nights of dreams when you rest your head
And all you could hope for is light now
And all you could wish for are distant colours
Of better days you paint when you lay awake for hours

You can say I'm wrong
Like you don't belong

But oh, this little love I hear so much about
I always give it back
Just give a little love, it's what they're talking about
I always give it back
Yeah, I give a lot just for a little love

Ah, ooh
Ah, ooh

But I'm getting by
Just getting on

But oh, this little love I hear so much about
I always give it back
Just give a little love, I keep dreaming about
I never feel that

But oh, this little love I hear so much about
I always give it back
Just give a little love, I keep dreaming about
I never feel that
But I give a lot just for a little love
