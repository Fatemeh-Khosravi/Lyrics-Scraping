"Wait & See"



When the night has come down
On the streets of this town it gets lonely
And the dreams that you found
In your sleep have run out of your mind
Don't be a fool
Don't let it fool ya
Cos there'll be new love when the sun comes around

I'll see you on the other side
I'll see you in the morning light
Where all will be good as new
Just wait and see what the morning can do

When the stars in the sky
Seem dusty and rusty and faded
And you can't seem to find any reason to carry on
Don't take it so hard
Just take it easy
And I'll see you in the light of the dawn

I'll see you on the other side
I'll see you in the morning light
Where all will be good as new
Just wait and see what the morning can do

Darling it's true
I'd never fool ya
It'll be good to see you there

I'll see you on the other side
I'll see you in the morning light
Where all will be good as new
Just wait and see what the morning can do
