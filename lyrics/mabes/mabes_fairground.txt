"Fairground"



Love is a fairground
I spent my last pound tryna win
Now I'll never be the same again
Love is a shotgun
That I've just put those bullets in

And oh my god, I've gone again
Every time I go all in
Keep forgetting everything
Well, maybe you just can't win

Now I got issues
Cos I really miss you all the time
Watched you cross that borderline
Now I'm barely breathing
Cos love is an ocean I can't swim

And oh my god, I've gone again
Every time I go all in
Keep forgetting everything
Well, maybe you just can't win

And oh my god, I've gone again
Every time I go all in
Keep forgetting everything
Every time I go all in
Keep forgetting everything
Well, maybe you just can't win

Love is a fairground
And I spent my last pound on this thing
Maybe you just can't win
