"Might As Well"



Each day slipping away
Killing my brain
Running out of patience
Are we the same?
'Cause I can't draw
Any correlations

It's all too much
Oh, my God
I need a revelation
Can't get a grip, I'm spacing out

Might as well
Try to be someone else
Try to be someone else
It's hard as hell
Tryna be someone else
Wishing I was someone else

New day, same old pain
Stuck in this place
With my reputation
They know my name
Some of 'em claim
To know my information

It's a waiting game
Mama keeps saying
I need a little patience
But I'm sick of it, I'm spacing out

Might as well
Try to be someone else
Try to be someone else
It's hard as hell
Tryna be someone else
Wishing I was someone else

Maybe I can find my place
In a mess or a prison, have faith
Get out the other side okay
Get out the other side alright
For now another part to play

Might as well
Try to be someone else
Try to be someone else
It's hard as hell
Tryna be someone else
Wishing I was someone else
