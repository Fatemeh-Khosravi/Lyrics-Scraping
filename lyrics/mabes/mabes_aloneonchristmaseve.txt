"Alone On Christmas Eve"



Sometimes I do too much thinking
Waste time smoking and drinking
'Bout time I got a grip on my life

Midnight falls from the ceiling
Tree lights are burning with meaning
'Cause I'm missing my baby tonight

Right where you used to be
An empty ever-green
Alone on Christmas Eve

They say time is a healer
Fuck them, I'll drink this tequila
'Cause I don't wanna feel anymore

Our wintertime retreat
No longer feels complete
Alone on Christmas Eve

I'll play The Pogues when I'm lonely
Guess you're the Shane to my Kirsty
How sad, I'm singing both parts on my own
