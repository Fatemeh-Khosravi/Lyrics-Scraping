"Gone"



Seeing you smile, each morning we'd lay
Reading the paper, late for the day
Drinking our coffee just to keep us awake
But it's wrong, now you're gone

Having you there at the end of the day
Seeing you chases my troubles away
And driving through town as the radio plays
Our favorite song, now you're gone

And I got lost in the wind, dear
When you let me go
And I said, "Run for your life, dear"
Never knew I'd miss you so

If I could go back and tell you the truth
That baby I'm certain now I've got the proof
You just don't know what you got till you lose someone
Now you're gone

And I got lost in the wind, dear
When you let me go
And I said, "Run for your life, dear"
Never knew I'd miss you so

Now all I have is a memory to hold
And all of the while that memory gets old
And I'm stuck at midnight while the world carries on
'Cause everything's wrong, now you're gone
Now you're gone
