"Caught Up"



Counting down the days to see your face
'Cause somehow on a screen is not the same
Dreaming of a day when I can let my hair down
And lay my head down on you
Dreaming of a place where I can be myself now

And we can get caught in the moment
Lose all our focus, forget the work we've gotta do
Move in slow-motion
Taking no notice of what this world is coming to
And get caught up in the moment

Caught up, up, up
Caught up, up, up
Caught up in the moment with you
Caught up, up, up
Caught up, up, up
Caught up in the moment

We know that we're onto something real
But I'm losing touch of how it feels
Dreaming of a day when I can let my hair down
And lay my head down on you
Dreaming of a place where I can be myself now

And we can get caught in the moment
Lose all our focus, forget the work we've gotta do
Move in slow-motion
Taking no notice of what this world is coming to
And get caught up in the moment

Caught up, up, up
Caught up, up, up
Caught up in the moment with you
Caught up, up, up
Caught up, up, up
Caught up in the moment

Dreaming of a day when I can let my hair down
And lay my head down on you
Dreaming of a place where I can be myself now

And we can get caught in the moment
Lose all our focus, forget the work we've gotta do
Move in slow-motion
Taking no notice of what this world is coming to
And get caught up in the moment

Caught up, up, up
Caught up, up, up
Caught up in the moment with you
Caught up, up, up
Caught up, up, up
Caught up in the moment
