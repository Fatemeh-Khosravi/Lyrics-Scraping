"Free"



Come out of your house
Got a lot to do
Don't remember the last time I really saw you
If you can't decide
Just who you wanna be
Be the foolish one to run away with me

Well, how else will you know what it's like to be free?

One day, we'll get up and run
Up and run, up and run
Catch our breath and stalk the sun
Stalk the sun, stalk the sun
Pack your bags tonight
And I'll see you on the other side
One day, we'll get up and run
Up and run
We could be free
We could be free

It's colder in my house
I couldn't patch the cracks
Since the walls came tumblin' down in the avalanche
And the wind, it howls
And the lightnin' bleeds
And I'm in the darkness, but I can't sleep

How will I ever know what it's like to be free?

One day, we'll get up and run
Up and run, up and run
Catch our breath and stalk the sun
Stalk the sun, stalk the sun
Pack your bags tonight
And I'll see you on the other side
One day, we'll get up and run
Up and run

Spendin' our days livin' this way
Wide awake, get a game to play
When we can't win, we only lose
What we got to lose?

'Cause one day, we'll get up and run
Up and run, up and run
Catch our breath and stalk the sun
Stalk the sun, stalk the sun
Pack your bags tonight
And I'll see you on the other side
One day, we'll get up and run
Up and run
We could be free
We could be free
We could be free
We could be free
