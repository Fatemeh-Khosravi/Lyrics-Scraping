"Sugarush"



Coming up, really thought I was caught on a wave
Hit and run when it's done got me feeling a way, oh
And cutting up trouble is double the fun these days
And I'm getting withdrawal though it makes me sick to say

'Cause every time you touch
It's like a sugarush, but
It's bittersweet
I seen those other girls that you meet, well
Don't leave me high and dry
Don't want no temporary high, baby
I want relief, honey stick to me
'Cause it's just like sugar

Grab a cup, fill it up like gasoline
Gotta kill what you're fuelling inside of me, oh
And I ain't usually like this, I ain't got the time to waste
But it's something 'bout the way you taste to me, so sweet
My honey, know you know what I mean

Ah, my blood runs a darker shade of blue for you
Ah, I hate it but it's true

'Cause every time you touch
It's like a sugarush, but
It's bittersweet
I seen those other girls that you meet, well
Don't leave me high and dry
Don't want no temporary high baby
I want relief, honey stick to me
'Cause it's just like sugar

'Cause every time you touch
It's like a sugarush, but
It's bittersweet
I seen those other girls that you meet, well
Don't leave me high and dry
Don't want no temporary high baby
I want relief, honey stick to me
'Cause it's just like sugar
