"Keeping The Noise Down"



It's nice to meet ya
Wait, I remember
Met ya at the back of that club once
Your brother's got a cool car
Sorry, I was just heading to the bar
I think I need to get drunk

Fallen out of place
Don't know what's my problem
Don't know why I came
Wish I had forgotten, oh, oh, oh

I'm in the corner of the party
Keeping the noise down
Keeping the noise down
I don't get to be like everybody
Running around the house
Running their mouths out
I'm just keeping the noise down

Not even dark out
Sam's got the car back
There's a crowd outside
Has no one heard the door ring?
Midnight it looks like
Everyone's having the time of their whole damn life
To me it's just boring

Fallen out of place
Don't know what's my problem
Don't know why I came
Wish I had forgotten, oh, oh, oh

I'm in the corner of the party
Keeping the noise down
Keeping the noise down
I don't get to be like everybody
Running around the house
Running their mouths out
I'm just keeping the noise down

Best friend said I should just get over myself
Working out the world like everyone else
I'm alone in a crowded room and it hurts like hell
Oh well

I'm in the corner of the party
Keeping the noise down
Keeping the noise down
