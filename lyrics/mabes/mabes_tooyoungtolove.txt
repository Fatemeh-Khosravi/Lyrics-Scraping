"Too Young To Love"



Set in stone
Are we though?
Or is it just a stepping stone on the road
I never saw myself with someone else
But lately whenever I'm by myself
Suddenly part of me is overthinking everything unconsciously
Do all of these emotions that we felt mean something else?

Could I really let you go
When you're everything that I want
Or am I getting too comfortable with you?

I'm losing my mind just a little
'Cause they say, "You'll know when you know"
But is holding onto us even worse than giving up?
'Cause, baby, I'm caught down the middle
I know I should know, but I don't
Could it be it's not enough
Or are we just too young to love?

You and me
On paper we look like a dream
But now I see
Reality is all of these emotions that we felt
Mean something else

Could I really let you go
When you're everything that I want
Or am I getting too comfortable with you?

I'm losing my mind just a little
'Cause they say, "You'll know when you know"
But is holding onto us even worse than giving up?
'Cause, baby, I'm caught down the middle
I know I should know, but I don't
Could it be it's not enough
Or are we just too young to love?

Are we just too young to love?

Maybe we're not old enough
Old enough to call it love
Maybe we don't know enough to know it's love

I'm losing my mind just a little
'Cause they say, "You'll know when you know"
But is holding onto us even worse than giving up?
'Cause, baby, I'm caught down the middle
I know I should know, but I don't
Could it be it's not enough
Or are we just too young to love?

Could it be it's not enough
Or are we just too young to love?
